# Intrusion detection system
NIDS - network based ids - key points on a network, internal to external, segmentation points
HIDS - host based ids - installed on hosts, servers, workstations

# Intrusion prevention system
NIPS and HIPS
prevention = detects and prevents

detection:
signature based: database of known threats, alligns events with that
anomoly based: unusual traffic, something new, can use machine learning for this
sensors: in or out of network, notify NIDs

## NIPS = inline mode: extra firewall, passive mode: data alerts sent to IDS, no extra firewall

### results from NIPS and NIDs
false positive
true positive
false negative: worst of all

### NAC - network access control
- enforeces policy
