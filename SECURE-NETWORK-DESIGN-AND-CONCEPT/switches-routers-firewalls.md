# key def

router tables - a delivery table, think of it like yellow pages
NAT - network address translation - map multiple local private addresses to a public address before transporting data = this hides the internal network
ACL - routers and firewalls in use, prevent access to certain things, if no rules defined all packets are rejected
switches - internal, connects the LAN, CAM containing mac address, shows which host is cinnecred to which port on the switch


Port security - ports turned off by default
802.1x - certificate authentication before connect, physical wired or wireless connections whereas RAS is for VPN
loop protection - STP prevents loops, switch aggregation
BDPU - defends layer 2 STP
MAC filtering - white and black list


### Firewalls
back2back - one facing in and the other facing out

the different types of firewalls

host based - endpoint device
network based - back to back for example
stateful - tracks and monitors normally on layer 3 or 4
stateless - only grants or denies
web app firewall - web server
UTM - content, url, malware, viruses
next gen - against cyber threats advanced
open source - leff effective than paid firewalls, can see the code
