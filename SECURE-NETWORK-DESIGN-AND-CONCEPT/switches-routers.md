router tables - a delivery table, think of it like yellow pages
NAT - network address translation - map multiple local private addresses to a public address before transporting data = this hides the internal network
ACL - routers and firewalls in use, prevent access to certain things, if no rules defined all packets are rejected
switches - internal, connects the LAN, CAM containing mac address, shows which host is cinnecred to which port on the switch


Port security - ports turned off by default
802.1x - certificate authentication before connect, used in radius
