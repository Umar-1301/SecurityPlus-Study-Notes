Accounts need to be created in line with outlined practices and policies as it ensures:
- Easier management
- Uniform Identification

For example, forcing usernames to be written as 'm.krony' instead of first full name and second.
Say we have an unauthorised user within our system. It would be easier to spot them if they do not abide by our policy. Furthermore enforcing policies such as regular password changes, acts as a authorisation control
at the staff level as it enhances security and decreases the chance of the password being exploited
