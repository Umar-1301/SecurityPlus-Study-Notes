WLAN - wireless LAN
Guest network - wireless network for guests
  -> connect through WAP - wireless access point

all devices that want to connect to the internet go through a WAP except AdHoc - 2 devices connect wirelessly without the need for WAP

WiFi analysers - analyse wifi, checking strength, channel capacity, network overviews and troubleshooting
WIDS - wireless IDS

WAPS have limitations:
walls,doors etc weaken the signal strength

This can be represented through a heatmap of the WAPS strength. In an organisation you do not want this too strong or too weake
Too string will mean people outside of the desired location can see it, and too weak means users may not be able to access it

We have 2 types:
- Omnidirectional antenna: 360 degree coverage from a point
- Directional antenna: covers the area it is facing


In order to control a WAP we have wireless controllers
These offer centralised management, configuration, laod balancing, security enforcement

FAT controller - Standalone WAP that has its own storage of DHCP addresses and all configs on the WAP
DHCP = dynamic host configuration protocol = gives ip addresses to devices on a network
Thin controllers - used for remotely accessing and managing multiple waps


### security for waps
* change username and password
* diable SSId to make it not visible
* enryption
* MAC filtering
* 802.11 wireless standards - state how wireless communcation should be done

### channels for wireless networks
channels are different paths allowing multiple wireless networks to operate within its own channel without inteferring with the other
the channels cary by frequency used - 5ghz or 2.4ghz
to ensure no interference, these channels should not overlap
